# Multi-Threaded-File-Backup-Restore-using-Java.
This project demonstrates efficient file backup &amp; restore using Java multithreading. Large files are split into chunks, processed in parallel for speed, and stored in unique timestamp directories to prevent overwriting. I used ExecutorService for managing threads and FileChannel for I/O, supporting files like .txt, .jpg, .png, .mp4, .mp3, etc.
